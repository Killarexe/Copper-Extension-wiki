Copper blocks can oxidize during time. And this mod adds the ability to copper items like ingots, nuggets, etc... to oxidize in your inventory. **Item oxidation applies only when the item is in an inventory of an entity like the player or a zombie, and when it's dropped.**

**Oxidation speed/chance can be configured via the gamerule `copperOxidationChance`**, which was added since Copper Extension 1.2.1. More info [here](../../configuration).

Here is the list of the oxidation chance per versions:

| Version | Chance of oxidation |
|-------- | ------------------- |
| 1.0.0   | $$1.3 \% \ chance/item/s$$ for Fabric; $$27.3 \% \ chance/item/s$$ on Forge |
| 1.1.0   | $$2.7 \% \ chance/item/s$$  |
| 1.4.2   | $$0.3 \% \ chance/item/s$$  |
| 1.5.0   | $$0.004 \% \ chance/item/s$$|
