In vanilla Minecraft, copper blocks can be waxed by right-click the block with a honeycomb. With Copper Extension, you can wax copper items to prevent oxidizing via two methodes:

## 1. Craft the waxed item with a honeycomb

Just put the copper item with a honeycomb on the crafting table or the internal crafting space in you inventory, and you get the waxed item.

## 2. Using a beehive

Copper Extension add a feature that when you right-click a copper item on a beehive which have honey in it, it will wax the item. This will consume 1 honey on the beehive.

You can shift right-click to wax the maximum amount of item you can wax.
