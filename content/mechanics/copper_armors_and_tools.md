With the Minecraft copper update, they introduce copper armor and tools. Since Copper Extension 1.5.0, **this mod adds oxidation states for the copper armor and tools.** Each oxidation layer have there pros and cons. 

TODO: add copper armor screeshot

First, for the copper armor and tools, **the more they are oxidized, the less enchant power they get.** So a brand new copper pickaxe will have better enchantements on the enchantement table than an oxidized copper pickaxe. Also, **copper armor get more durability the more it's oxidized.**

Pros and cons list:

| Oxidation stage | Pros | Cons |
| --------------- | ---- | ---- |
| Exposed         | +0.25 base damage | -0.5 base speed |
| Weathered       | TODO | TODO |
| Oxidized        | TODO | TODO |

Each oxidation level of the copper armor can give different potion effects thanks to the [Lightning Effect](../lightning_effects) feature.
