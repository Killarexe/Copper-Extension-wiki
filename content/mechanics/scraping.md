In Copper Extension oxidized/waxed items can be scraped to remove oxidation or the wax layer. Like in vanilla Minecraft, **the oxidation is removed by using an axe.** To do it, you'll need to **put the axe on the off hand, and then your item you want to scrap on the other hand. Then right-click to scrap.** And if you want **to do all at once, then shift right-click.**
